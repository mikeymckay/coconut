#Case Notification

The health facility sends a notification that a new malaria case has been detected via their mobile phone. When this notification is received, a SMS is sent to the DMSO for that health facility. This SMS tells the DMSO that they have a new case to followup. They must then get their tablet online (via mobile network or wifi) and press the "Get Data" button. This will download all new case data within that DMSO's district of responsibility and save it as a Case Notification record. The data is as follows:
