#Household

After data is collected from the reporting facility, the DMSO will use the information to find the household where the patient lives. This usually involves calling the patient or going to the house of the Sheha to find the correct household.

A household may be visited for one of the following reasons:

  1) A health facility found that a resident of the household was positive (index case)
  2) A nearby house has had a positive malaria result
  3) The house is located in a mass screening zone

The household location is captured using GPS technology. For this to work, the DMSO does not need an internet connection, but they do need an unobstructed path to the sky. The location should be captured standing outside in a clear area (not inside a house, or standing under tree cover).

Mosquito nets (LLINs) or coupons for mosquito nets may be provided based on the answers to the questions (if they have more sleeping places and residents than they have nets).
